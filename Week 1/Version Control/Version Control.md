## <a name="_i399ilaum2mx"></a>**What is a “Version Control System”?**
Version control systems are a category of software tools that help track changes made to files. They are essential for developers to record modifications in code, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions when needed.

**🔑 Key Skill:** Learning version control — especially Git — is a fundamental skill for developers.

For Learner’s Space, we’ll focus on **Git** and **GitHub**
### <a name="_bxnqgksqwrrt"></a>**Git**
Git is a version control system — a tool that lets you track changes made to files over time. It's especially useful for developers working on code, as it allows you to:

- Save versions of your project at different stages.
- Undo mistakes by reverting to older versions.
- Collaborate with others without messing up each other's code.
- Branch out and experiment without affecting the main codebase.
### <a name="_imdn41qzbw5h"></a>**GitHub**
GitHub is an **online platform** where you can **store your Git repositories in the cloud** and share them with others. It provides:

- **Remote storage** for Git repositories.
- Tools for **collaboration** (pull requests, issues, comments).
- A place to **showcase your projects**, contribute to open-source, or work in teams.

Git and github are related in the same way as a word document and google docs!

### <a name="_b0l2ozu26r0p"></a>**For macOS:**
Most versions of MacOS will already have Git installed, and you can activate it through the terminal with git version.  However, if you don't have Git installed, you can install the latest version of Git as listed below:

This is where you’ll commit files into your **local repositories**, before pushing them to **remote repositories** (like GitHub).
