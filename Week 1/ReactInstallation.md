<h2>📘 React.js Installation Guide for Students</h2>

**🎯 Introduction**

**React.js** is a powerful JavaScript library developed by **Meta (formerly Facebook)** for building user interfaces, especially in **single-page applications (SPAs)**. It enables developers to build fast and interactive web applications with reusable components.

This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment and creating your first React application. It includes hands-on steps to get you started quickly with React concepts.

💡 Tip: Practice while you follow along. It’s the best way to learn!

**🛠️ Step-by-Step Installation Guide**

**✅ 1. Installing Node.js and npm**

React uses **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install and manage its dependencies.

**📥 Download and Install Node.js**

- Go to the official website: <(https://nodejs.org/en/download)>
- Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Run the installer and follow the instructions.

If both commands show version numbers, Node.js and npm are installed successfully.

**✅ 2. Creating a React Application**

You can easily create a React project using the **Create React App** tool, which sets up everything you need to start coding immediately.
