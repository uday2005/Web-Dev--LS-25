## <a name="_wa32ptvtlsmu"></a>﻿**Networking Basics**

Before we dive into building websites and apps, let’s get a quick look at how communication happens over the internet. Think of it like a digital conversation — your browser sends a message (called a request) to a server, and the server replies with the information you asked for. Simple, right?

## <a name="_wa32ptvtlsmu"></a>**What Will We Learn?**
**Web Development** is all about creating websites and web applications — the tools and experiences you interact with online. It involves:

- **Web Design**: Visual layout and user experience
- **Web Publishing**: Deploying and managing content
- **Web Programming**: Making the site dynamic
- **Database Management**: Storing and managing data

From the visual design to the behind-the-scenes code, we’ll explore both sides of the process.

Let’s break it down:

- **Web**: Refers to anything online — websites, web apps, and web pages.
- **Development**: The process of building those tools from scratch.

### <a name="_3yh1u35m0k90"></a>**Two Sides of Web Development**

|**Frontend**|**Backend**|
| :-: | :-: |
|What the user sees|What powers the app behind the scenes|
|HTML, CSS, JS, React|Django (Python), Databases|


Here are the roadmaps you can take for each:

Frontend: <https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner>   or    <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/frontend-developer-roadmap/>

Backend: <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backend-developer-roadmap/>

Note that you must know the basics of both and then can delve deeper into any one side. Here you will get started with web development so you must go through both front and back development sections.


During the next **four weeks**, we’ll learn how to:  

- Build interactive interfaces with **React**

- Handle server-side logic using **Django**

- Style our projects using **modern CSS frameworks**

- Integrate backends using **databases**

## <a name="_r5x02kwj7jxw"></a>**Code Editors: Where You’ll Build Magic**
**To write code, you need a good editor. We recommend:**

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code) –** Our official editor for the sessions
- **Others you may try:** Sublime Text, Notepad/TextEdit (for quick edits)
### <a name="_587pb12jijj9"></a>**Quick Productivity Boosters in VS Code**
- **Emmet Shortcuts (built into VS Code!):**

  - ! → Hit enter after typing this in an HTML file to get a ready-to-go template.
  - lorem → Auto-generates dummy text. Add a number like lorem25 for 25 words.
- **Live Server Extension:**
  - No more refreshing the browser! Save your file and see the changes instantly in the browser.

Now that you have your text editors ready, you can start writing your HTML and CSS codes. Go through the [HTML and CSS](./HTML+CSS.md) section to learn more.

Now that you can make beautiful static sites, let’s make it responsive and dynamic using [Javascript](./JavaScript.md)


## <a name="_wa32ptvtlsmu"></a>**What's Next?**

We’ll now move ahead with the **frontend framework: React.js**. It will give you hands-on experience with how modern websites are built and help you understand what more you need to know in **JavaScript** to work effectively with React.

But before you dive in, make sure you’re comfortable with all the concepts covered in this document — they’ll form the foundation for everything that comes next!

Get ready to create the kind of websites you've always admired — practise and do as many assignments as you can for each section to gain mastery.
