<h1>‚ö°Ô∏è Week 1: JavaScript Basics ‚Äì Let's Bring Webpages to Life!</h1>

Welcome to Week 1 of your course on Web Development with JavaScript!
 Now that you're comfortable with HTML and CSS, it's time to learn JavaScript‚Äîthe engine behind interactivity on modern websites.
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to build dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly websites. With it, you can create popups, animations, form validations, and even entire applications directly in the browser.
Your goal this week is to master the basic syntax and core concepts of JavaScript, so you‚Äôre well-equipped to start building exciting projects next.

<h3>üß© Topics to Cover This Week</h3>

Start by understanding variables and data types‚Äîlet, const, var, and primitive types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. Then, move on to functions, including how to declare them, pass parameters, and return values.

Next, explore DOM manipulation techniques like using querySelector, getElementById, changing innerHTML and textContent, modifying style, and toggling classes with classList. This will help you understand how to connect your JavaScript logic with actual elements on a webpage.

Learn about event handling, such as attaching addEventListener to elements and handling mouse and form events. Study conditionals using if, else, and comparison operators to write logic that reacts to user input.

Understand loops, including for, while, and forEach, especially for iterating through arrays. Deepen your understanding of arrays‚Äîhow to create them, access elements, and use useful methods like push, pop, and map.

Then, dive into objects, where you'll learn to create and use key-value pairs, access properties, and update values dynamically. As optional learning, check out timers with setInterval and setTimeout, and form handling, including using input.value, preventing default behavior, and validating form inputs.
