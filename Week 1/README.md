Hello everyone! 👋\
We’re thrilled to have you start your web development journey with us. This week is all about laying the **foundations**—understanding the basics, setting up your tools, and preparing for the exciting weeks ahead.

## <a name="_2rspjka1m6i0"></a>**1. Basics of Web Development**
Start by reading through the [Basics of Web Development](./Basics%20of%20Web%20Development.md) section in the main guide. Focus on understanding:

- How the internet works 🌐

Learn the basics of [Version Control](./Version%20Control/Version%20Control.md):
