# CSS Frameworks

By now, you’ve covered the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and you’ve installed **React JS**. But before jumping into React, let’s first explore **external CSS frameworks**.

> **Why?**  
Because frameworks like **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS** help you build modern, responsive layouts **faster** and **more efficiently**. You’ll be amazed by how much time you save once you start using them!

## Why Use a CSS Framework?

Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature                    | Traditional CSS | Bootstrap / Tailwind |
|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Time to build layouts      |   Longer       |   Much faster        |
| Responsiveness             | Manual media queries | Prebuilt responsive utilities |
| Code readability           | OK             | Clean, modular classes |
| Reusability                | Limited        | Highly reusable |

## Let’s Start with **Bootstrap**

### What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a **free**, open-source framework that includes prebuilt **CSS** and **JavaScript** components like:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Navbars
- Grids
- Alerts
- Modals

It saves you from writing repetitive styles and helps you build **responsive websites quickly**.

### Setting Up Bootstrap

#### Use the CDN (Recommended)

No need to download anything! Just include the Bootstrap CDN link in your HTML:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

More info here: [**Bootstrap Introduction**](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

Practice Task (Optional)
---------------------------

Build a fun project using Bootstrap!

Try the the following challenges using everything you learnt in react and bootstrap:

*   Task Tracker App 
    
*   Project 2: Interactive Quiz App
    
*   Project 3: Memory Card Matching Game

- Download the Practice Folder

- Try replicating the layout shown in the goal.png    

### How to Download:

1.  Go to the [Practise folder](./Practise)
    
2.  Copy the GitHub URL
    
3.  Use [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/)
    
4.  Extract the ZIP
    
5.  Open it in **VS Code** and start coding!
    

Tailwind CSS (Completely Optional)
-------------------------------------

Tailwind is another modern CSS framework. Unlike Bootstrap, it doesn’t come with ready-made UI components. Instead, it provides **utility classes** that you can mix and match to build any layout.

> Example:Instead of .btn-warning, you’d write:bg-yellow-300 font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded
