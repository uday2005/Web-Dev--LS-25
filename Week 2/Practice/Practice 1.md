## <a name="_xx8ub3ube50w"></a>**Practice 1: Task Tracker App**
### <a name="_hkjta7xovuj4"></a>**Project Statement:**
**Build a simple Task Tracker (To-Do List) web app using React.**\
The application should allow users to add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. This project helps practice React fundamentals such as components, state management, event handling, and conditional rendering.
### <a name="_9gdizrl2trmx"></a>**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand React component structure
- Manage state using *useState*
- Handle form inputs and events
- Conditionally render UI elements
- Dynamically render lists using *.map()*
### <a name="_3snqo2bruo47"></a>**Requirements:**
1. **Add Task:**

   - An input field and a button to add a new task.
1. **Display Tasks:**

   - Show tasks in a list format with:
      - Task name
      - Checkbox or button to mark as completed
      - Button to delete a task
1. **Task Filters:**

   - Buttons to filter tasks: All, Active, Completed
1. **Basic Styling:**

   - Use CSS or inline styles to make the app visually clean.
### <a name="_175e54gwkdvk"></a>**Bonus (Optional):**
1. **Add Due Dates & Priority Levels:**

- Allow users to assign a **due date** and a **priority tag** (High, Medium, Low) to each task.
- Sort tasks dynamically from **highest to lowest priority**, and optionally group or highlight tasks nearing their deadline.
1. **Smart Completed Task Handling:**

- When a task is marked as completed:
  - Apply a **strikethrough and fade effect** (reduced opacity or transparent text)
  - Automatically **move it to the bottom** of the task list for better visibility of pending tasks.
1. **Integrated Task Timer:**

- Enable users to set a **countdown timer** for individual tasks.
- Useful for focus-based productivity techniques like the **Pomodoro Method**.
- Optionally show a “Time Remaining” indicator next to each task and trigger an alert when time is up.
1. **Dark Mode Toggle:**

- Provide a simple toggle to switch between **Light and Dark themes**.
- Improves accessibility and allows users to work comfortably in different lighting environments.
