## <a name="_fdcwtc1d520z"></a>**Practice 2: Interactive Quiz App**
### <a name="_i49kr93qrc79"></a>**Project Statement:**
**Build a dynamic and responsive Quiz Application using React.**
The app should present a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, allow them to select answers, and provide feedback or a final score upon completion. This project reinforces key React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, conditional rendering, and event handling.
### <a name="_dcnakoiihgx6"></a>**Learning Outcomes:**
- Use *useState* to manage dynamic UI behavior
- Handle user input via events
- Use *map()* to render question and option lists
- Conditionally render components (e.g., show score only after quiz ends)
- Pass data using props and structure reusable components
