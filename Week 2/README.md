# WEEK 2: From Frameworks to React

Hey everyone!  
Hope you had fun exploring the basics last week — HTML, CSS, JS, Figma, and version control. This week, we’ll go one step further and dive into **frameworks** — tools that’ll make your sites more powerful and professional with way less effort.

Let’s begin!

---

## 1. CSS Frameworks

Last week you styled everything from scratch. This week, let the [**Frameworks**](./Frameworks.md) do the heavy lifting. Instead of writing tons of CSS, just plug in some pre-written classes and boom — responsive, beautiful layouts! 

### Start with Bootstrap

- Focus on **components** (buttons, navbars, cards) and **utilities** (spacing, flex, grid, colors)
- Learn how to use **CDN** to plug Bootstrap into your HTML easily

*Practice Task:* Try recreating simple layouts using Bootstrap’s grid system and utility classes.

Optionally, explore **Tailwind CSS** if you're curious about a utility-first framework — we’ve included resources for both.

## 2. Learn React JS (The Star of Frontend)

[**React**](./ReactJS.md) is the core framework we'll be using going forward. It’s component-based, super efficient, and widely used by companies like Airbnb, Meta, and Netflix.

### Why React?

- Lets you **create reusable UI components** like `<Navbar />`, `<Footer />`, etc.
- Helps manage complex UIs by breaking them into smaller chunks
- Makes your code cleaner and more organized

**What to Cover This Week:**
- How to install and run a React app (using Vite or Create React App)
- JSX syntax and why it’s different from HTML
- Components and props
- State and simple event handling

## 3. Assignment (Mandatory)

You'll get a simple assignment to test what you’ve learned so far.  
Make sure you finish it before the deadline so you stay on track!

---

## 4. Optional Practice

Explore the **Practice Folder** for Bootstrap-based project challenges.

How to try it:

1. Open the [**Practice folder**](./Practise)
2. Copy the repo link
3. Paste it into [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/)
4. Extract the ZIP
5. Open it in **VS Code**
6. Complete the challenges using React and Bootstrap

✅ **This week’s goals:**
- Understand how CSS frameworks simplify design
- Install React and build your first component
- Complete the Week 2 assignment
- (Optionally) Try Bootstrap project challenges

Remember, the goal is to build confidence and get hands-on.  
Don't worry if you don’t “get it” immediately — ask doubts, review your peers’ work, and build cool stuff. You got this 

Happy coding!
